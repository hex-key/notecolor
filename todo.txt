small prerequisite tasks
- making and moving oval shapes on annotation 
- importing and exporting 4sc
	technically not necessary because permanent annotations can be written over, but.. rather not
	ok . it seems like this is not the best use of time so i think, just try to make the output editable in apple markdown, then corrections can be made, though annoying :(


computer vision tasks
- identify notes 
	both quarter & half.. ornaments are probably a little ambitious 
- calculate note value 
	relative to scale
	key signature -- honestly i think its not horrible to make key signature a command line argument... but it can change... but surely writing like 3s 50 4f 20 is not that bad . idk. 
	accidentals...

nice-to-haves
- quick shift (change all c to c-sharp or something... kind of a fallback if the key sig stuff doesnt work out)

how i Think it should work

- identify staves
- for each row, go until find a note [how exactly to do? sliding window? how to know note size? ig usually based on staff size but must determine for weird engravings]
- if note is indeed there and centered on that line, check for accidental, then colour if solid note and outline if half/whole note 

side things
- key signature... not quite sure

project evolution
- find and colour one line (on the staff) of perfect musescore scan that is just like, quarter note c major scale or something
- be able to iterate over lines (on the staff)
- iterate over lines (in the score)
- add detection of whole and half notes 
- accidentals 
- key signature
